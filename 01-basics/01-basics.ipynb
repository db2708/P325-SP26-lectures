    "```bash\n",

    "Python 3.12.3 (main, Nov 6 2025, 13:44:16) [GCC 13.3.0] on linux\n",

    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Remember, in this class `$` indicates a terminal prompt, and `>>>` indicates a Python prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also open a terminal in VS Code using the `Terminal` > `New Terminal` menu. Give it a try! When you \"press play\" to run your code, this also opens a terminal, with the additional step of running your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once in the Python prompt, you can enter any valid Python code and it will be interpreted line by line. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> print(\"Hello World!\")\n",
    "Hello World!\n",
    "```\n",

    "Python commands can also be collected in a single file, where the extension `.py` indicates that the file is a Python program.\n",
    "The contents of the file are run through the Python interpreter, which reads through the program and determines what each word in the program means. For example, when the interpreter sees the word `print` followed by parentheses, it prints to the screen whatever is inside the parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you write your program, your editor highlights the different parts of your program in different ways. For example, it recognizes that `print()` is the name of a function and displays that word in one color. (Yellow, for me.) It recognizes that `\"Hello World!\"` is not Python code, and displays that phrase in a different color. This is called syntax highlighting and is incredibly useful for beginners and experts.\n",

    "You've already made one program: the Hello World program you wrote on the first day to test that everything is working. Congratulations, you are officially a programmer!"

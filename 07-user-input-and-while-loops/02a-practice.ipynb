    "When buying tickets to a movie, your age determines which movies you're allowed to see (G, PG, PG-13, R). Write a `while` loop that asks a user for their age, then prints the highest rated movie they are allowed to see. Include a quit prompt that will use `break` to stop the loop. Can you think of a reasonable use for the `continue` statement in this example?"
